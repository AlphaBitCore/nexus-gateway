# Normalization architecture

The normalize layer turns raw provider/wire bytes into a canonical `NormalizedPayload` — readable text, token usage, and request/response structure — independent of which provider or wire format produced them. It lives in `packages/shared/transport/normalize` and is shared by the AI Gateway, Compliance Proxy, and Agent (request-path enforcement) and the Control Plane (view-time recompute), so the same bytes yield the same normalized result everywhere. The canonical projection is **not persisted on the audit write path**; the Control Plane recomputes it on demand from the stored (already-redacted) body when an operator opens the Traffic drawer — see §5.2 and [audit-pipeline-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/observability/audit-pipeline-architecture.md).

## 1. The NormalizedPayload contract

A `Normalizer` (`packages/shared/transport/normalize/core`) implements:

```go
type Normalizer interface {
    ID() string
    Normalize(ctx context.Context, raw []byte, meta Meta) (NormalizedPayload, error)
}
```

`Meta` carries the call context: `AdapterType` (the wire key), `Model`, `ContentType`, `Direction` (`DirectionRequest` / `DirectionResponse`), `EndpointPath`, and `Stream`. `NormalizedPayload` is the canonical output — `Kind` (`ai-chat` / `ai-embedding` / `http-json` / …), `Protocol`, `Model`, `Stream`, `Messages[]`, `Tools[]`, `Params`, `Usage`, `FinishReason`, `Inputs[]` (embeddings), `Confidence`, and `DetectedSpec`. A normalizer that does not recognize the bytes returns `ErrUnsupported`, which the coordinator uses to fall through to the next candidate.

A `TransformSpan` describes one byte-level modification against a `NormalizedPayload` (a hook redaction, AI-Guard suggestion, cache-normaliser strip, or cache_control inject); `ApplySpans` reconstructs the wire body from the payload + its spans. A span's `ContentAddress` indexes the modified content (e.g. `messages.<i>.content.<j>`, `http.bodyView`). The reserved address `AddressAuditOnlySentinel` (`"webhook.flat"`) marks an **audit-only** span: it records *what* a subsystem flagged but addresses a flat projection the gateway never reconstructs, so `ApplySpans` drops it — it lands in the audit record only and never mutates delivered or stored bytes. `IsAuditOnlySentinelAddress` is the single recogniser; compliance consumers use its negation as a denylist to tell an applicable redaction from an advisory audit-only span (see `hook-architecture.md` §5, `CarriesRedaction`).

## 2. The tiered dispatch model

`core.Registry` is the coordinator. `BuildRegistry` (`packages/shared/transport/normalize/buildregistry.go`) assembles it once per service and freezes it. `Registry.Normalize` dispatches in tiers:

- **Tier 1 — keyed per-wire normalizers** (`normalize/codecs`, registered by `RegisterDefaultAIBuiltins`, plus per-host traffic adapters via `RegisterTier1AdapterNormalizers`). Selected by `AdapterType` and `AdapterType::EndpointPath` keys — JSON wires with a known shape.
- **Tier 1.5 — the sniff pass.** When every keyed candidate missed or declined, the registry offers the body to codecs enrolled via `RegisterSniffer` (anthropic, openai-chat, openai-responses, gemini — in that precision order). Each implements the optional `core.Sniffer` capability: `LooksLike(raw, meta)` probes a bounded prefix for protocol-distinctive markers in BOTH directions. Response markers are probed unconditionally (the Anthropic `message_start` SSE frame, the OpenAI `chatcmpl` / `"object":"chat.completion` discriminators, the Gemini `"candidates"` key plus a corroborating Gemini key); request markers are probed only when `meta.Direction` is request or unset — anthropic matches `"messages"` + `"max_tokens"` (the pair is protocol-required on `/v1/messages`), openai-chat matches `"messages"` + `"model"` with an `"author"` exclusion (chatgpt-web requests carry the same pair but wrap the role in an `author` object and belong to the Tier-2 chatgpt-web spec), gemini matches `"contents"` plus one of `"generationConfig"` / `"systemInstruction"` / `"safetySettings"`. An Anthropic request body satisfies both the anthropic and openai request probes (`messages`+`model`+`max_tokens` is a superset); registration order resolves the ambiguity — anthropic probes first, so the stricter marker set wins. A match runs the same claim contract as Tier 1. This is how key-missed capture traffic — whose `AdapterType` carries a host or tool name rather than a wire key, and whose path resolves nothing — still lands on the full-fidelity codec instead of the pattern probe or the verbatim dump, in both directions. Probe precision is pinned by the cross-corpus sniffer matrix test (`codecs/sniffer_test.go`): no sniffer outside a case's allowed set may probe-match its corpus wire, and the request-direction walk-order discrimination is pinned end-to-end by `TestRequestSniffOrderDiscrimination` plus the `*-req-keymissed` corpus goldens.
- **Tier 2 — consumer-web pattern probe + NonJSONDetector framework** (`normalize/extract`, wired by `WireTier2`). The JSON probe recognises only consumer-web shapes the codecs do not own — the ChatGPT-web request/JSON-Patch-SSE pair, the claude.ai single-prompt request, and the flat-prompt legacy completions shape. Standard-API wires (OpenAI Chat, Anthropic Messages, Gemini, OpenAI Responses) are deliberately NOT patterned here: the Tier-1 codecs decode them by key, path, or sniff, and a duplicate Tier-2 spec would only produce a lower-fidelity second answer. For wires that are not plain JSON the detector chain runs: a protobuf Connect-RPC envelope (`ConnectRPCProtobufDetector`) or a Google `batchexecute` form post (`BatchExecuteDetector`). Each detector implements `ID()` / `LooksLike(raw)` / `Decode(raw, direction)`.
- **Tier 3 — generic HTTP** (`GenericHTTPNormalizer`). The catch-all that records non-AI HTTP structure when no AI wire matches.

A tier's result is accepted only when its `Confidence` clears the registry threshold (default 0.70); otherwise the coordinator continues to the next candidate.

**Confidence semantics — one meaning per input shape.** Confidence always answers "what fraction of this input did the decoder recognize", with the denominator defined by the input's shape:

| Input shape | Formula | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Stream (SSE fold) | recognized frames / total data frames (`[DONE]` and blank data lines are sentinels, counted in neither; an unparseable or alien-shape frame counts toward the total only — the decodable prefix folds instead of erroring; a scanner abort on an oversized line weighs as one lost frame). Recognition is envelope-key presence (openai: id/object/created/model/choices/usage; gemini: candidates/usageMetadata/modelVersion; anthropic: the typed frame vocabulary), value-empty or not, so filter-prologue and heartbeat frames cannot demote a real stream below the claim threshold | `anthropic_stream.go`, `openai_chat.go` stream fold, `gemini_stream.go` — each fold sets `Confidence` itself; the codec's `Normalize` wrapper stamps only when the fold left it unset. Known incompleteness: `openai_responses.go` folds its stream into a synthesized document and field-shape-scores that, and the Cohere SSE codec has no fold at all (its streams field-shape-score the first chunk) — frame-coverage semantics for both is ledgered future work |
| Single JSON document | weighted field coverage: 0.50 baseline + 0.40 × required-key ratio + capped optional bonus − bounded unknown-key penalty, range [0.40, 1.00] | `core.ScoreTier1Confidence` (`core/confidence.go` carries the full rubric and the rationale for each weight) |
| Consumer-web patch stream | applied patch frames / patch-candidate frames, gated on a signature key (`conversation_id` / `message_id`) appearing in at least one raw frame — probed at the frame's top level and nested one hop under the patch value (`v.conversation_id`, the delta-encoding stream variant's only placement) | Tier-2 chatgpt-web response probe |
| Non-JSON detector (protobuf / batchexecute) | weighted signal coverage: 0.60 baseline + 0.30 × required-signal ratio + bounded bonus − unknown penalty, range [0.50, 1.00] | `extract/detector.go` |
| Fallback projection | constant 1.0 — full confidence in the PROJECTION (see §4.1); makes no AI-semantics claim | `generic_http.go` |

One deliberate exception: **host selection evidence**. `extract.NormalizeForAdapter` (entered from a per-host adapter that already resolved the producer by host evidence) stamps `SelectionEvidence=host` on its payload and KEEPS the honest decode coverage (single-prompt consumer-web specs like claude-web cap near 0.6 — they extract the prompt and nothing else). The Registry's `tryClaim` accepts a `SelectionEvidence=host` payload over the 0.70 threshold on the strength of that host match, not the coverage number — the host IS the source of truth for "this is adapter X traffic", so dropping a correctly-attributed row to the generic-http fallback merely because its coverage is honestly low would be a strictly worse operator outcome. Because coverage and selection-evidence are different scales, the UI renders a "host-matched" label in place of the numeral for these rows (mirroring the Structural badge's numeral suppression). The earlier design floored confidence to 0.95 instead; that floored number is retired — it made an honest 0.6 read as more trusted than a real sniffed decode. Adapter-keyed callers likewise satisfy the chatgpt-web signature gate by host evidence alone; key-missed Tier-2 traffic keeps the strict gate so coverage alone never claims a foreign patch stream.

## 3. Canonical usage normalization

Every normalizer maps the upstream's native token counts onto one canonical `Usage` (`normalize/core`):

```
PromptTokens · CompletionTokens · TotalTokens · CacheReadTokens · CacheCreationTokens · ReasoningTokens   (all *int)
```

The convention is OpenAI's, so cost and analytics never branch on provider:

- **Anthropic** — wire `input_tokens` counts uncached input only, so the normalizer sets `PromptTokens = input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` and `CompletionTokens = output_tokens` (`codecs/anthropic_messages.go`).
- **Gemini** — `PromptTokens = promptTokenCount`, `CompletionTokens = candidatesTokenCount + thoughtsTokenCount`, `CacheReadTokens = cachedContentTokenCount`, `ReasoningTokens = thoughtsTokenCount` (`codecs/gemini_generate.go`).
- **OpenAI-compatible family** — `codecs/openai_chat.go` resolves the cached-token alias chain across vendors (DeepSeek `prompt_cache_hit_tokens`, Moonshot `prompt_cache_tokens`); the Responses-API top-level `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` mapping lives in `codecs/openai_responses.go`.

This is the contract `core.ExtractUsage` in the AI Gateway depends on — see [provider-adapter-architecture.md](provider-adapter-architecture.md) §5.

## 4. Text and structure extraction

Beyond usage, a normalizer reconstructs the conversation into `Messages[]`, each a `core.Message` with a role and a `[]ContentBlock`. Content blocks carry typed payloads — `text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, and `reasoning` — so the audit pipeline stores readable normalized text and preserves tool and chain-of-thought content rather than dropping it. Embedding wires populate `Inputs[]` and `Usage` instead of messages. Streamed responses are folded frame by frame (`normalize/extract/accumulator.go`) into a single final payload.

A Tier-1 codec whose surface is captured as a self-contained SSE stream folds that stream itself before decoding. `codecs/openai_responses.go` is one case: a streamed `/v1/responses` egress is stored as the raw Responses-API event stream the client received (`event: response.output_text.delta` … terminated by `response.completed`, which carries the complete response object). The codec collapses that stream to the terminal response object — falling back to the accumulated `output_text` deltas when the capture is truncated before the terminal event — so a streamed row normalizes to the same `Messages[]` + `Usage` as a non-streamed one instead of failing the JSON decode on the leading `event:` framing and emitting an empty payload. `codecs/anthropic_stream.go` folds the Anthropic `/v1/messages` event stream the same way: content blocks are reassembled in stream order (`text_delta` runs → a `text` block, `thinking_delta` runs → a `reasoning` block, `input_json_delta` runs → a `tool_use` block with the accumulated JSON decoded into the input), the model arrives on `message_start`, the stop reason and output-side usage on `message_delta`, and `LooksLikeAnthropicSSE` routes the body to the fold even when the capture lost the stream flag and Content-Type. Shared SSE line-splitting lives in `codecs/sse_fold.go` (`walkSSEFrames`, which also carries each dispatch's `event:` name to the callback), used by the OpenAI Chat and Anthropic stream folds and the generic-http SSE projection.

### 4.1 Fallback projections (generic-http)

Traffic no AI tier claims still gets a TYPED structural projection, never a blind dump. `GenericHTTPNormalizer` (`codecs/generic_http.go`) routes by byte sniff first — capture-side Content-Type headers are routinely missing or mis-stamped, so the bytes outrank the header — then by declared Content-Type:

| Wire shape (sniff/CT) | Kind | Body view | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSE framing (first non-comment line opens `event:` / `data:` — leading `:` keep-alive comment lines are skipped within a 256-byte probe window; a declared `text/event-stream` Content-Type routes here even when a longer preamble defeats the sniff) | `http-sse` | `sseFrames[]` — one frame per `data:` line: `event` name + `data` (decoded JSON tree) or `dataText` (verbatim string, at most one set — an empty data line carries neither) | Capped at 2000 frames AND 1 MiB cumulative frame data + `sseTruncated:true` (together they bound the persisted row; the raw bytes remain in the Raw view, which is also why the frame list never duplicates the verbatim text) |
| NDJSON (two+ independently complete JSON lines) | `http-json` | `json` — array of the decoded lines | One bad line invalidates the NDJSON assumption → text projection |
| Valid JSON document (first non-ws byte `{`/`[` + whole-body `json.Valid`) | `http-json` | `json` — decoded tree | Claims regardless of declared Content-Type; invalid JSON never enters (a declared-JSON body that fails the decode keeps the explicit error path: text projection for UTF-8 prose, binary digest + surfaced error otherwise) |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | `http-form` | `form` — key→value map (multi-valued keys newline-joined) | |
| `multipart/*` | `http-multipart` | `form` — field-by-field text; file parts decay to a `<file len=N>` marker | Missing boundary → binary digest |
| `text/*`, or no Content-Type with UTF-8-looking bytes | `http-text` | `text` — verbatim | |
| Everything else | `http-binary` | `binaryRef` — size + sha256 only, bytes never inlined | |

**Provenance semantic.** Every payload this normalizer emits — all branches above plus decode-error partials — stamps `detectedSpec:"generic-http"` and `confidence:1.0`. The 1.0 means full confidence in the projection itself: a structural projection is always a faithful rendering of what it claims to be. It makes zero claim about AI semantics — "no AI spec identified" is what the `generic-http` value says, never a lowered score. The UI renders the provenance chip on fallback rows from these two fields (as a neutral "Structural" badge that suppresses the confidence numeral — printing 1.00 next to a Tier-1 decode's 0.95 would read as more trusted than the real decode).

**Hook scannability.** `NormalizedPayload.TextProjection()` (`core/projection.go`) is the contract that keeps every typed projection visible to content-scanning hooks (keyword, PII): `http-sse` projects one entry per frame (verbatim `dataText`, or the re-marshaled `data` tree), and an `http-json` tree projects as its compact re-marshaled document. A new fallback Kind MUST extend `httpTextProjection` in the same change — a Kind the projection cannot read is content a configured `http`/`all` hook silently stops scanning.

## 5. Reuse across services

`BuildRegistry` wires every tier — `codecs.RegisterDefaultAIBuiltins` (which also enrolls the Tier-1.5 sniffers), `adapters.RegisterTier1AdapterNormalizers`, `extract.WireTier2` — and freezes the registry. Each service builds it once at startup and calls `Registry.Normalize`:

- **AI Gateway** — `core.ExtractUsage` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/core/usage_extractor.go`) is the entry point; each codec's `DecodeResponse` delegates there.
- **Compliance Proxy** — wires the registry to normalize intercepted request/response bodies (`packages/compliance-proxy/cmd/compliance-proxy/wiring/normalize.go`).
- **Agent** — normalizes a client's outbound traffic on the forward path (enforcement / hook input).
- **Control Plane** — recomputes the normalized projection at view time, on demand, from the stored (already-redacted) request/response body when an operator opens the Traffic drawer (`GET /traffic/:id/normalized`). No producer persists the projection on the audit write path, and the Hub neither self-derives nor backfills it — see [audit-pipeline-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/observability/audit-pipeline-architecture.md) §10.2.

Because all four build from the same assembly, the same upstream bytes produce byte-identical canonical output regardless of where they were captured. A new provider's usage or text mapping is added once, in the shared layer, and every service inherits it. The interception-side detail (per-host adapters, Tier-2 detectors for consumer surfaces) is in [compliance-pipeline-architecture.md](../compliance-proxy/compliance-pipeline-architecture.md).

### 5.1 AI Gateway audit key selection — always the ingress format

The AI Gateway captures request/response bodies in the client (ingress) wire shape and persists `rec.IngressFormat` — the **authoritative ingress wire-format key** — onto `traffic_event.ingress_format` so the Control Plane's view-time recompute selects the right codec. The key is the ingress wire format for **both** directions — never the routed upstream adapter — because every byte buffer the gateway captures is in the client (ingress) wire shape:

- **Request** bytes are captured at handler dispatch in the client's wire shape. The codec translates `A → canonical → B` only for the bytes sent upstream, which are never the captured `RequestBody`.
- **Response** bytes are always re-encoded back to the ingress shape (`B → canonical → A`) before they touch `rec.ResponseBody`. Every capture site does this: non-stream responses are stored after `egressReshapeNonStream`; the streaming tee wraps the client `ResponseWriter` so it buffers the per-chunk-reshaped SSE the client received; error bodies are `EncodeErrorEnvelopeForIngress` output. There is no path where the captured response bytes are in the upstream provider's wire shape.

So a non-Gemini model (e.g. OpenAI `o1`) served over the Gemini `:generateContent` ingress records its response in Gemini `candidates[]` shape and is keyed on `gemini` → the Gemini normalizer claims it at Tier 1 (`kind=ai-chat`). Cross-format ingresses whose format has no adapter-only registration (`/v1/responses`, where the ingress format is `openai-responses`) resolve through the registry's path-keyed fallback (`::/v1/responses`); SSE that no Tier-1 key folds is claimed by the matching codec through the Tier-1.5 sniff pass, and only shapes no sniffer recognizes reach the Tier-2 SSE walker. The persisted key is `traffic_event.ingress_format` (stamped from `rec.IngressFormat`), consumed by the Control Plane view-time recompute (`GetTrafficEventForNormalize` reads it, lower-cased; an empty value — agent / compliance-proxy rows that carry the domain-matched adapter id, or older rows — falls through to the path-and-sniff resolution). See [traffic-capture-storage-normalize-design.md](traffic-capture-storage-normalize-design.md) for the ingress-frame invariant and the cross-protocol rationale.

### 5.2 AI Gateway lazy canonical (compute-on-demand)

The request-path canonical (`buildRequestContext` → `Registry.Normalize`) is
computed only when a synchronous consumer needs it:

- **Lazy compute.** `buildRequestContext` installs a lazy normalize seam and
  materializes the canonical only when a synchronous consumer pulls it — the
  response cache stage (when `cacheEnabled`) or a `smart` routing rule (the only
  strategy that reads `rctx.Request.Messages`, gated by
  `Handler.smartRouteNeedsCanonical` → `Resolver.RequestNeedsCanonical`, recursive
  over the strategy tree via `core.ConfigReadsContent` / `StrategyTreeReadsContent`).
  Each consumer is fail-safe — it pulls the canonical on any uncertainty. When no
  consumer needs it, the request path leaves it nil.

`NEXUS_LAZY_CANONICAL` gates this (default **on**; set `NEXUS_LAZY_CANONICAL=0`
to force always-compute as a kill-switch). The gate decision is consumer-derived
and independent of the ingress↔upstream spec relationship.

**The audit path runs no normalize.** The gateway does not stamp
`request_normalized` / `response_normalized` on the audit row, and the request
canonical is not reused for audit — the audit path runs no `Normalize` and no
`json.Marshal` of the canonical on the request goroutine. The normalized
projection is recomputed at view time by the Control Plane from the stored
(already-redacted) body, so it is neither produced on the latency path nor
persisted on the write path. See §5 and
[audit-pipeline-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/observability/audit-pipeline-architecture.md) §10.2.

## 6. Adding a normalizer or detector

- **Tier-1 normalizer** — implement `Normalizer` in `normalize/codecs`, register it in `codecs/register.go` under its `AdapterType` (and `AdapterType::EndpointPath`) keys, and stamp `Confidence` via `ScoreTier1Confidence` so a low-confidence parse can fall through to Tier 2. If the wire has a cheap protocol-distinctive prefix marker, also implement `core.Sniffer` and enroll it via `RegisterSniffer` so key-missed capture traffic reaches the codec; every new probe must keep the cross-corpus sniffer matrix (`codecs/sniffer_test.go`) clean.
- **Tier-2 detector** — implement `NonJSONDetector` and append it to `NonJSONDetectors` in `normalize/extract/detector.go`; `WireTier2` picks it up automatically.

**Sharp edge:** the standard-API vendor adapters (`packages/shared/traffic/adapters/api/*`) carry no `Normalize` method — the shared codecs own their wire-format keys (`anthropic`, `openai-compat`, `gemini`, …) via `RegisterDefaultAIBuiltins`. Per-host `Normalize` methods exist only on consumer/IDE surfaces, and those whose wire IS a standard API delegate to the shared codec singletons (`codecs.SharedOpenAIChat()` et al.), re-stamping `DetectedSpec` with their adapter ID for provenance. Adding a `Normalize` method to a vendor adapter whose ID a codec already owns panics Hub startup with a duplicate registration — that panic is the lock-step guard, mechanized by a registration test (`adapters/register_builtins_test.go`).
